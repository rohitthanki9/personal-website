    <!-- <h1>About Me</h1> -->

    <p>I am a <strong>Technical Lead & Data Scientist </strong> at DetMedX (R & D Group of KRiAN) in Wolfsburg, Germany. I bring over five years of expertise in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven MedTech specifically applied to the healthcare and retail sectors. I have 10+ years of research experience in advanced technologies such as computer vision, medical data analysis, biometrics, data security, and signal processing, which equip me with a deep understanding of innovative technology and its practical applications. I focus on developing creative, AI-powered solutions that address critical challenges in the healthcare industry, ensuring technological excellence and regulatory compliance.</p>

    <p>I am involved in research and the development of AI-driven healthcare technologies, specializing in telemedicine, medical diagnostics, and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). This includes spearheading software development as a medical device (SaMD) and aligning these innovations with industry regulations to ensure market readiness and patient safety. Throughout my career, I have contributed to advancements in AI and healthcare through various high-impact roles:</p>

    <p>I was the Head of Research and Development at Prognica Labs Tech FZCO (Dubai, UAE), where I oversaw the creation of AI-powered diagnostic tools to improve cancer detection accuracy.</p>

    <p>I also worked as a Consultant for Ennoventure Technologies Private Limited (Bengaluru, India), providing AI consultancy to optimize medical data security and AI-driven solutions for patient monitoring and telemedicine platforms.</p>

    <p>In each of these roles, I successfully developed and deployed AI systems that leverage computer vision, data security protocols, and biometric analysis to enhance medical imaging, diagnostics, and secure data handling in healthcare. These innovations improve patient outcomes, reduce diagnostic errors, and enhance the overall efficiency of medical systems.</p>

    <p>One of my core competencies is medical device regulatory compliance, a critical aspect of introducing innovative healthcare technology to the market. With extensive experience in developing software as a medical device (SaMD), I have a deep understanding of the requirements of medical device regulations. I also have experience in technical writing, ensuring that all product documentation, clinical data, and validation reports comply with the stringent guidelines set by these regulatory bodies. This ensures that my AI-based healthcare solutions meet technological standards and maintain patient safety, data security, and regulatory approval for global market access.</p>

    <p>With a solid academic foundation, including a Doctorate in Electronics and Communication specializing in computer vision and data security, I have contributed extensively to academia and industry. I have 3+ years of teaching experience in engineering institutions in India, strengthening my ability to translate complex technological concepts into practical applications for industry professionals and academic audiences.</p>

    <p>I have authored over 20 technical books published by leading publishers such as Springer, CRC Press, and Elsevier. Key publications include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) using Artificial Intelligence</em></li>
      <li><em>AI Role in Haptic Healthcare</em></li>
      <li><em>Artificial Intelligence for Early Detection and Diagnosis of Cervical Cancer</em></li>
      <li><em>Artificial Intelligence in Breast Cancer Early Detection and Diagnosis</em></li>
      <li><em>Explainable Machine Learning in Medicine</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p>As a result of these contributions, Stanford University and Elsevier ranked me among the top 2% of AI and image processing scientists in 2024. My research is regularly published in top-tier Web of Science and Scopus-indexed journals, reflecting my commitment to advancing the field of AI in healthcare.</p>
